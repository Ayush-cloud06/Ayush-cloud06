## Ayush Yadav 👨‍💻

**☁️ Cloud Security & Compliance | 🧱 IaC • 📜 Policy as Code • ⚙️ Security Automation**

I design and build **secure-by-design, compliant-by-default** cloud systems by embedding security and governance directly into infrastructure and deployment workflows.

### 🔐 Core Domains

* Cloud Security Architecture
* Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
* Policy as Code (OPA / Rego)
* Compliance Automation & Guardrails
* CI/CD Security Enforcement
* Preventive Governance Engineering

---

### 🛠️ What I Build

* 🚦 Compliance-gated CI/CD pipelines (block insecure infra before deploy)
* 🧩 Security-first Terraform modules and baselines
* 🧠 Cloud policy engines using OPA (Rego)
* 🔍 Automated security posture validation
* 🔄 Drift detection & remediation workflows
* 📊 Audit-ready evidence generation

---

### 📜 Compliance & Governance Focus

I work on mapping regulatory and security frameworks into real cloud controls:

* 🏛️ ISO 27001
* 🛡️ SOC 2
* 📏 CIS Benchmarks
* 🧾 GDPR (technical safeguards & control enforcement)
